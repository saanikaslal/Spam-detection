🧠 Spam Detection using LSTM + Profit Data Visualization
📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates two key machine learning and data analysis concepts:

Spam Detection using LSTM (Deep Learning) — A text classification model that classifies emails or messages as spam or ham (not spam).

Data Visualization — Analyzing and visualizing product-based profit data using Matplotlib and Pandas.

📁 Dataset

The dataset has the following columns:

Column	Description
Unnamed: 0	Row index (can be ignored)
label	Text label (ham/spam)
text	Email/message content
label_num	Numeric label (0 = ham, 1 = spam)
